Fix all the following issues in order:
1. Fix Yellow Disclaimer Box
Remove the caution icon completely. Keep only the text in the yellow box with no icon and no white background circle. Make the disclaimer text more concise.
2. Update Recognition Threshold Sliders
Change the three threshold categories to:

Children Deaths Threshold: "How many children need to die before you'd call it systematic targeting?"
People Deaths Threshold: "How many people need to die before it's concerning?"
Hospital Destruction Threshold: "What percentage of hospitals destroyed makes it 'systematic infrastructure targeting'?"

Remove the journalist deaths threshold completely. Update all references to these three categories throughout the code.
3. Remove Empty Gradient Box
Delete the empty black gradient box that appears above "Reality Check: Current Situation in Gaza". The Reality Check section should start cleanly without any decorative gradient elements above it.
4. Completely Redesign Reality Check Section
Create a powerful new design that shows the stark contrast between user thresholds and reality:
REALITY CHECK DESIGN:
- Use a side-by-side comparison layout
- Left side: "Your Thresholds" (what user selected)
- Right side: "Current Reality" (actual numbers)
- Use visual bars or progress indicators showing how far reality exceeds thresholds
- Add percentage indicators like "Reality is 460% above your threshold"
- Use red color progression - darker red for higher excess
- Include impactful one-liner for each stat like "That's 14 children per day"
- Make numbers HUGE and impossible to ignore
- Add subtle animation when numbers load (count up effect)
5. Fix Persistent Loading States
Find all instances of "Loading real-time data..." text and ensure they're replaced with actual data once loaded. Remove the loading indicator after data fetch is complete. Check the updateStats() or fetchData() function.
6. Fix Last Updated Date
Replace the forever-loading state with a simple static date. Find where it says "Last updated:" and just hardcode "Last updated: June 23, 2025" without any loading animation.
7. Redesign Final Dark Section
The memorial/final section needs complete redesign:
NEW DESIGN:
- Change background from pure black to dark blue-gray (#1e293b)
- Increase text contrast with white or light gray text
- Add subtle background texture or gradient for depth
- Make the quote larger and more readable (font-size: 1.5rem minimum)
- Add proper spacing (padding: 4rem)
- Style the action buttons with better contrast
- Add hover effects to buttons
- Ensure all text has proper line-height for readability
- Consider adding a subtle border or frame around the quote
Additional Instructions:

Test all changes on mobile devices
Ensure smooth transitions between sections
Remove any console.log statements
Verify all data loads properly without infinite loading states
Make the entire experience more impactful and emotionally resonant while maintaining professionalism

CRITICAL: The Reality Check section is the heart of this experience. Make it impossible to ignore - use bold design choices, strong contrast, and clear visual hierarchy to communicate the severity of the situation.
