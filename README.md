# The Genocide Recognition Calculator

An interactive web application that challenges users to confront their thresholds for recognizing humanitarian catastrophe through a provocative calculator interface that reveals the stark reality of ongoing crises.

## üéØ Project Overview

The Genocide Recognition Calculator is a powerful educational tool designed to challenge our collective desensitization to humanitarian crises. Through a unique four-phase narrative journey, users are guided from satirical engagement to sobering reality, ultimately leading to constructive action.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Threshold Calculator**: Users set their own "recognition thresholds" for humanitarian concern
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Live data from Tech For Palestine APIs
- **Progressive Narrative Revelation**: Four distinct phases with evolving visual and emotional tones
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices and screen sizes
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with screen reader support
- **Performance Optimized**: Single-file deployment with minimal dependencies

## üì± Screenshots

The experience adapts its visual design and messaging across four distinct phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Satirical Calculator (Light, accessible design)
2. **Phase 2**: Reality Check (Transition to darker themes)
3. **Phase 3**: Timeline (Somber, memorial-style presentation)
4. **Phase 4**: Memorial & Action (Hope and constructive engagement)

## üõ† Technical Architecture

### Built With

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **APIs**: Tech For Palestine humanitarian data APIs
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4
- **Hosting**: Static file hosting (Replit, GitHub Pages, Netlify compatible)

### Design System

- **Typography**: Modern system font stack for optimal performance
- **Color Progression**: CSS custom properties enabling seamless theme transitions
- **Layout**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive design
- **Animations**: CSS transitions and keyframes for smooth interactions

## üé® Design Philosophy

The UI/UX deliberately evolves throughout the user journey:

- **Satirical Opening**: Light, almost playful design to draw users in
- **Reality Transition**: Progressive darkening as real data is revealed
- **Memorial Phase**: Somber, respectful presentation honoring victims
- **Action Phase**: Hopeful, constructive design encouraging engagement

## üìä Data Sources

- **Primary**: [Tech For Palestine APIs v2](https://data.techforpalestine.org/)
- **API Endpoint**: `https://data.techforpalestine.org/api/v2/summary.json`
- **Real-time Updates**: Casualty figures including total killed, children, women, and more
- **CORS Proxy**: Uses `api.allorigins.win` to bypass cross-origin restrictions
- **No Authentication Required**: Public APIs accessible client-side
- **Last Updated**: July 11, 2025 (57,823 total killed, 18,000 children, 12,400 women)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Any modern web browser
- Python 3.x (for local development server)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/how-many-more.git
   cd how-many-more
   ```

2. **Start local server**
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 5000
   ```

3. **Open in browser**
   ```
   http://0.0.0.0:5000
   ```

### Deployment

This is a static single-file application that can be deployed anywhere:

#### Replit (Recommended)
- Fork this Repl
- Click "Run" to start the development server
- Use Replit's deployment features for production

#### Other Platforms
- **GitHub Pages**: Push to `gh-pages` branch
- **Netlify**: Connect repository and deploy
- **Vercel**: Import project and deploy

## üìà Analytics & Tracking

The experience includes comprehensive analytics to understand user engagement:

- **User Flow Tracking**: Journey through each phase
- **Threshold Analytics**: Distribution of user-set recognition thresholds
- **Engagement Metrics**: Time on page, scroll depth, interaction patterns
- **Conversion Tracking**: Click-through rates to humanitarian organizations

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### API Data Not Loading
- **Issue**: "Unable to Load Current Data" error message
- **Cause**: CORS restrictions or API connectivity issues
- **Solution**: The app uses a CORS proxy (api.allorigins.win) to bypass browser restrictions. If the proxy is down, data may not load.

#### Content Security Policy Errors
- **Issue**: Console errors about CSP violations
- **Solution**: All necessary domains are whitelisted in the CSP header, including the CORS proxy

#### Slow Loading Times
- **Issue**: API requests taking too long
- **Solution**: The app implements a 5-minute cache and retry logic with exponential backoff

### Technical Details
- **API Version**: Tech For Palestine v2 API
- **Primary Endpoint**: `/api/v2/summary.json`
- **CORS Proxy**: `https://api.allorigins.win/`
- **Cache Duration**: 5 minutes
- **Retry Attempts**: 3 with exponential backoff

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Details

### API Integration
```javascript
// CORS proxy implementation
const corsProxy = 'https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=';
const proxiedUrl = corsProxy + encodeURIComponent(apiUrl);

// Data structure returned by API
{
  "killedInGazaListCount": 55202,
  "massacres": 12000,
  "killed": {
    "total": 57823,
    "children": 18000,
    "women": 12400,
    "civilDefence": 115,
    "press": 228,
    "medical": 1584
  },
  "injured": {
    "total": 137887
  },
  "lastDailyUpdate": "2025-07-11"
}
```

### Security Headers
- Content Security Policy includes all necessary domains
- No inline styles or scripts (CSP compliant)
- All external resources properly whitelisted

## üîí Privacy & Security
